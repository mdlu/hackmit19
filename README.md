TongueFu is a Kahoot!/Jackbox style game, where you compete to say the given tongue-twister into your phone as quickly and accurately as possible. 

Our app is build using Node, React, MongoDB, Tensorflow/Python, and the Rev speech-to-text API. This project was created for the 2019 HackMIT hackathon, held from September 14-15.

```bash
# To run locally
# This will probably not work until you get .env from the guy.
npm install
# For the frontend
npm run dev
# Then do this in a different terminal for the backend
npm run startdev
